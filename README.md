# ➿REW-P5
Porting and upgrade of [REW](https://github.com/danieledep/REW) game from Processing to P5.js.
A new chapter of the same music cassette whose tape keeps on unrolling out of place until some brave spinning wheels will find its way to harness the tape. It has performance issues to fix.

## Controls
- <kbd>&#8592;</kbd> or <kbd>A</kbd> to make the wheel turn left
- <kbd>&#8594;</kbd> or <kbd>D</kbd> to make the wheel turn right
- <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Left click</kbd> to pause/unpause the game   

## To-dos
- [ ] add record button ⏺ to save a screenshot
- [ ] make controls work well on mobile
- [ ] fix bouncing direction from the walls by using polar coordinates
- [ ] when intersecting tape update tape also for wheel n-1 and n+1
- [ ] fix performance issues when there are lots of wheels
